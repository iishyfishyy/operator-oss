/* Shared definitions for the orchestrator's agent-facing MCP tools.
 *
 * The SAME tool names, descriptions and parameter docs feed two places that
 * expose these tools to a coding agent:
 *   - lib/agents/claude/driver.ts   the in-process SDK MCP server (createSdkMcpServer)
 *   - scripts/orch-mcp.mjs          the portable stdio MCP bridge (Codex + future CLIs)
 * Keeping the strings here means the two can never drift.
 *
 * Plain .mjs on purpose: it's imported both through Next's bundler (the Claude
 * driver, TS) AND by raw Node ESM (the bridge script, plain JS) — same shape as
 * lib/cf-access.mjs. Only literal data lives here (no zod, no SDK types) so both
 * consumers can build their own schema objects from it. Every such .mjs the
 * bridge needs must also be COPY'd into the runtime image (see Dockerfile).
