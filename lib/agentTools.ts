// Shared implementations of the orchestrator's agent-facing tools
// (suggest_task / expose_service). One home for the LOGIC so both callers agree:
//   - the Claude driver's in-process SDK MCP server (lib/agents/claude/driver.ts)
//   - the internal HTTP endpoints the stdio bridge proxies to
//     (app/api/internal/agent-tools/*), which serve Codex and any future CLI
//
// The tool *definitions* (names/descriptions/params) live in lib/agentToolDefs.mjs;
// this file is the behaviour behind them. Both are deliberately split so the
// plain-Node bridge (scripts/orch-mcp.mjs) can import the defs without pulling in
// the TS/SQLite graph.
